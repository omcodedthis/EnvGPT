# EnvGPT
EnvGPT is an AI chatbot built & hosted on [Steamship.](https://www.steamship.com/) It acts as a assistant / consultant that answers the user's queries with an environmental viewpoint. It has the ability to lookup various terms, translate text, summarise text as required to answer the user's queries using [OpenAI's](https://openai.com/) Large Language Models. It takes into consideration the environment wherever possible & includes it in its reply to the user. This is an early preview of AI-based software.

Above is a demo of the EnvGPT in action, hosted on Steamship. Apologies for the poor quality, it is due to GitHub's file limits & video compression.
