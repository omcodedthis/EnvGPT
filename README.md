# EnvGPT
EnvGPT is an AI chatbot built & hosted on [Steamship.](https://www.steamship.com/) It acts as a assistant / consultant that answers the user's queries with an environmental viewpoint. It has the ability to lookup various terms, translate text, summarise text as required to answer the user's queries using [OpenAI's](https://openai.com/) Large Language Models. It takes into consideration the environment wherever possible & includes it in its reply to the user.

Above are some screenshots showing how EnvGPT interacts with the user's query. This was taken using the CLI (Terminal) when testing EnvGPT before deploying to Steamship.

# Getting Started
I really wanted to provide a live instance of EnvGPT but Steamship has usage limits for free-tier accounts. You can still use EnvGPT by creating your own instance using the link provided below.

* Create a [Steamship](https://www.steamship.com/) account.
  
* Create your own instance of EnvGPT [here.](https://steamship.com/packages/envgpt-bot)
