# EnvGPT
EnvGPT is an AI chatbot built & hosted on [Steamship.](https://www.steamship.com/) It acts as a assistant / consultant that answers the user's queries with an environmental viewpoint. It has the ability to lookup various terms, translate text, summarise text as required to answer the user's queries using [OpenAI's GPT-4.](https://openai.com/gpt-4) It takes into consideration the environment wherever possible & includes it in its reply to the user. This is an early preview of AI-based software (AI Agents).

## Demo

Above is a demo of EnvGPT in action, hosted on Steamship. Apologies for the poor quality, it is due to GitHub's file size limits & video compression. As shown above, all its replies are given with an environmental lens.

Above shows how EnvGPT interacts with the user's query (using the tools it has to generate its response). This was taken using the CLI (Terminal) when testing EnvGPT before deploying it to Steamship. Click on the image to view an enlarged version in a new tab.


## Changelog & Future Updates
* Added support for Telegram Bots, you can do so [here.](https://github.com/steamship-packages/telegram-buddy/blob/main/README.md)
